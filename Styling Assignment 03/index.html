    <p class="para">
        On a distant morning, the quiet breeze carried stories that no one had yet written.
        Each ray of sunlight carved new meanings across the page, as if the world itself
        were whispering its forgotten tales. And so, the journey of letters began—step by step,
        line by line, forming a river of thoughts that drifted gently into the unknown.
